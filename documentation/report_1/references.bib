The models and estimation methods have since been extended to dealing with a broader series of problems, and have considerable advantages over the other methods developed for estimating such joint effects. Despite these advantages, the application of these methods in applied research has been relatively infrequent; we view this as unfortunate. To remedy this, we provide an overview of the models and estimation methods as developed, primarily by Robins, over the years. We provide insight into their advantages over other methods, and consider some possible reasons for failure of the methods to be more broadly adopted, as well as possible remedies. Finally, we consider several extensions of the standard models and estimation methods.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of assessing whether an exposure affects a dichotomous outcome other than by modifying a given mediator. The standard approach, logistic regression adjusting for both exposure and the mediator, is known to be biased in the presence of confounders for the mediator-outcome relationship. Because additional regression adjustment for such confounders is only justiÔ¨Åed when they are not affected by the exposure, inverse probability weighting has been advocated, but is not ideally tailored to mediators that are continuous or have strong measured predictors. We overcome this limitation by developing inference for a novel class of causal models that are closely related to Robins‚Äô logistic structural direct effect models, but do not inherit their difÔ¨Åculties of estimation. We study identiÔ¨Åcation and efÔ¨Åcient estimation under the assumption that all confounders for the exposure-outcome and mediator-outcome relationships have been measured, and Ô¨Ånd adequate performance in simulation studies. We discuss extensions to case-control studies and relevant implications for the generic problem of adjustment for time-varying confounding.},

	shorttitle = {Cumulative exposure to state-level structural sexism and risk of disordered eating},

	abstract = {Background
Gendered inequities in disordered eating are well-documented, yet few studies have examined their structural drivers. To help fill this gap, we investigated whether cumulative exposure to state-level structural sexism from childhood through young adulthood potentiates differences in disordered eating risk between cisgender girls/women and boys/men.
Methods
Participants came from the Growing Up Today Study (N¬†=¬†16,875), a cohort of children aged 9‚Äì14 years in 1996 who we followed through 2016. Using a composite index of relevant state policies and social inequalities from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, we categorized states as having high or low levels of structural sexism and summed the number of years participants had lived in a high structural sexism state during the study period to quantify their cumulative exposure. We fit sequential conditional mean models to estimate the effect of cumulative exposure on risk of four outcomes (chronic dieting, purging, binge eating, and overeating), controlling for individual- and state-level confounders via propensity scores. We then tested whether effects differed between girls/women and boys/men by including cumulative-exposure-by-gender-identity interaction terms and calculating the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI).
Results
In the full sample, each additional year of living in a high structural sexism state was associated with a 5\% increased risk of purging (95\% confidence interval (CI): 3\%, 7\%), an 8\% increased risk of binge eating (95\% CI: 6\%, 10\%), and a 9\% increased risk of overeating (95\% CI: 8\%, 11\%). Risk increases were larger on average for girls/women than for boys/men, and girls/women who had lived in a high structural sexism state for four or more years had excess risk of chronic dieting (RERI: 0.64, 95\% CI: 0.18, 1.10), purging (RERI: 2.64, 95\% CI: 1.24, 4.30), and binge eating (RERI: 2.21, 95\% CI: 0.93, 3.50).
Conclusions
Structural sexism may contribute to inequities in disordered eating between cisgender girls/women and boys/men. Future research should include transgender and gender diverse participants, explore intersectional effects, and identify underlying mechanisms to inform policy-oriented interventions.},
